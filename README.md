# Autoencoder

## What is an Autoencoder?

An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction, by training the network to ignore signal "noise".

## Architecture

An autoencoder consists of two main parts:

### 1. Encoder

- Maps the input data to a lower-dimensional latent space representation
- Compresses the input into a compact encoded representation
- Formula: `z = f(x)` where `x` is input and `z` is the encoded representation

### 2. Decoder

- Reconstructs the original input from the encoded representation
- Maps from the latent space back to the original input space
- Formula: `x' = g(z)` where `z` is the encoded representation and `x'` is the reconstruction

## Key Components

### Latent Space (Bottleneck)

- The compressed representation of the input
- Forces the network to learn meaningful features
- Dimensionality is typically much smaller than input

### Loss Function

- Measures the difference between input and reconstruction
- Common choices: MSE, Binary Cross-entropy, MAE
- Goal: Minimize reconstruction error

## Types of Autoencoders

1. **Vanilla Autoencoder**: Basic encoder-decoder architecture
2. **Sparse Autoencoder**: Adds sparsity constraint to hidden layers
3. **Denoising Autoencoder**: Trained to reconstruct clean data from noisy input
4. **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**: Probabilistic approach with regularized latent space
5. **Convolutional Autoencoder**: Uses CNN layers for image data

## Applications

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Compress high-dimensional data
- **Feature Learning**: Learn meaningful representations
- **Data Denoising**: Remove noise from corrupted data
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify outliers based on reconstruction error
- **Image Compression**: Lossy compression of images
- **Data Generation**: Generate new samples (especially VAEs)

## Advantages

- Unsupervised learning (no labeled data required)
- Flexible architecture adaptable to different data types
- Can learn non-linear transformations
- Useful for preprocessing and feature extraction

## Limitations

- May lose important information during compression
- Training can be unstable
- Prone to overfitting with limited data
- Quality depends heavily on architecture design

## Training Process

1. Forward pass: Input → Encoder → Latent representation → Decoder → Reconstruction
2. Calculate reconstruction loss
3. Backpropagate error through the network
4. Update weights to minimize loss
5. Repeat until convergence
